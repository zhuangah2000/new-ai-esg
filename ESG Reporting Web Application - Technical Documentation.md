# ESG Reporting Web Application - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The ESG reporting web application follows a modern full-stack architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance. The system is built using industry-standard technologies and best practices for enterprise-grade applications.

### Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework**: React 18 with modern hooks and functional components
**UI Components**: Shadcn/UI component library with Tailwind CSS for styling
**Charts and Visualization**: Recharts library for interactive data visualizations
**Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
**Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

**Backend Framework**: Flask (Python) with RESTful API design
**Database**: SQLite for development, easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL for production
**ORM**: SQLAlchemy for database operations and model management
**API Documentation**: Built-in endpoint documentation and testing capabilities
**CORS Support**: Flask-CORS for cross-origin request handling

### System Architecture

The application follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React frontend providing user interface and user experience
2. **Application Layer**: Flask backend handling business logic and API endpoints
3. **Data Layer**: SQLite database storing all application data with proper relationships

### Database Schema

The database design supports comprehensive ESG data management with the following key entities:

**Emission Factors Table**:
- Stores conversion factors for different emission categories
- Supports versioning and date-based validity periods
- Links to specific scopes and activity types

**Measurements Table**:
- Records actual activity data from users
- Automatically calculates emissions using appropriate factors
- Supports various measurement units and categories

**Suppliers Table**:
- Manages supplier information and contact details
- Tracks engagement status and data collection progress
- Supports hierarchical supplier relationships

**Targets Table**:
- Stores ESG targets and reduction goals
- Tracks progress against baseline values
- Supports different target types and timeframes

**Users Table**:
- Manages user authentication and authorization
- Supports role-based access control
- Tracks user activity and audit trails

### API Design

The backend API follows RESTful principles with consistent endpoint patterns:

- **GET** endpoints for data retrieval
- **POST** endpoints for creating new resources
- **PUT** endpoints for updating existing resources
- **DELETE** endpoints for removing resources

All endpoints return JSON responses with consistent error handling and status codes.

### Security Considerations

The application implements several security measures:

- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication for external access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user types
- **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin request handling
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through SQLAlchemy ORM

### Performance Optimization

Several optimization techniques are implemented:

- **Frontend Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of components for faster initial load
- **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Caching**: Browser caching for static assets and API responses
- **Compression**: Gzip compression for reduced bandwidth usage
- **Minification**: Optimized JavaScript and CSS bundles

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the ESG reporting application, ensure the following requirements are met:

**System Requirements**:
- Linux-based server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- Minimum 2GB RAM and 10GB storage
- SSL certificate for HTTPS (recommended)

**Network Requirements**:
- Inbound access on port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
- Outbound internet access for API integrations
- Domain name or static IP address

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd esg-reporting-app
```

2. **Backend Setup**:
```bash
cd esg_reporting_api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Database Initialization**:
```bash
 <Ignore this step>
```

4. **Frontend Setup**:
```bash
cd ../esg_frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

5. **Static File Configuration**:
```bash
cp -r dist/* ../esg_reporting_api/src/static/
```

6. **Start the Application**:
```bash
cd ../esg_reporting_api
python src/main.py
```

### Production Deployment

For production environments, consider the following enhancements:

**Database Migration**:
- Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better performance and scalability
- Implement database connection pooling
- Set up automated backups and disaster recovery

**Web Server Configuration**:
- Use Nginx as a reverse proxy for better performance
- Configure SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections
- Implement load balancing for high availability

**Application Server**:
- Deploy using Gunicorn or uWSGI for production-grade WSGI serving
- Configure process management and automatic restarts
- Implement health checks and monitoring

**Security Hardening**:
- Configure firewall rules and network security
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Set up intrusion detection and monitoring
- Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning

### Environment Configuration

Create environment-specific configuration files:

**Development Environment**:
```python
DEBUG = True
DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite:///esg_dev.db'
SECRET_KEY = 'development-key'
```

**Production Environment**:
```python
DEBUG = False
DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/esg_prod'
SECRET_KEY = 'secure-production-key'
```

### Monitoring and Logging

Implement comprehensive monitoring:

**Application Monitoring**:
- Log all API requests and responses
- Monitor application performance metrics
- Track user activity and system usage
- Set up alerts for errors and anomalies

**Infrastructure Monitoring**:
- Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, disk)
- Track database performance and query times
- Monitor network connectivity and latency
- Set up automated health checks

### Backup and Recovery

Establish robust backup procedures:

**Database Backups**:
- Daily automated database backups
- Weekly full system backups
- Monthly backup verification and testing
- Offsite backup storage for disaster recovery

**Application Backups**:
- Version control for all code changes
- Configuration file backups
