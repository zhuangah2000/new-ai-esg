# Web Application Design for ESG Reporting

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for an intuitive and functional modern web application tailored for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting. The application aims to streamline the process of collecting, managing, analyzing, and reporting ESG data, with a particular focus on emission factors, measurement data, and supplier management for Scope 3 emissions. The design prioritizes user experience, data accuracy, scalability, and compliance with leading ESG reporting frameworks such as GRI and SASB.

## 2. Proposed Technology Stack

### 2.1 Web Framework

For the web application, we propose using **React** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend. This combination offers a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for building modern web applications.

*   **React (Frontend):** React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability, making it ideal for developing complex UIs with interactive data entry forms, dashboards, and reports. React's large community and extensive ecosystem provide ample resources and libraries for various functionalities, including data visualization.

*   **Flask (Backend):** Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. It is highly flexible and allows for rapid development of APIs. Its simplicity and extensibility make it suitable for building a RESTful API that will serve data to the React frontend. Python's strong data processing capabilities and existing libraries for environmental calculations make Flask a natural fit for the backend of an ESG reporting application.

### 2.2 Database

For the database, we recommend **PostgreSQL**. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It supports advanced data types and complex queries, which will be beneficial for managing diverse ESG data, including structured emission factors, measurement data, and supplier information. Its strong support for JSONB (JSON Binary) data types also provides flexibility for storing semi-structured data, which can be useful for evolving ESG reporting requirements.

## 3. Application Architecture

The application will follow a client-server architecture, with the React frontend communicating with the Flask backend via RESTful APIs. The PostgreSQL database will serve as the primary data store for all ESG-related information.
